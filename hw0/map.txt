The address of main and recur are in objdump, as well as the address of the static data.

.text is an ipmortant segment (it stores all the code.) .data and .bss are important segments used
for dynamic allocation.

The stack is growing down.

The stack frame is 48 bytes on each recursive call

The base heap address is 0x121e010.  It is growing up.

There appear to be 12 bytes of padding between the two heap allocations (they aren't contiguous.)
